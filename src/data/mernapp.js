    description: 'Commercially speaking, I predominantly work on the Front end of applications, if I want to dabble more in server side tech I generally have to build it myself.  Granted, this solution is built by following a step by step tutorial but it shows that I am familiar with certain concepts; building an API, connected to a MongoDB database and all the CRUD operations that connect the two. \n Furthermore, shows that I have had exposure to and am capable of connecting a client-side SPA built with React + Redux.  Also, unlike many commercial projects, I have access to and am able to show the source code. I tend to follow a set tutorial till completion, then extend and tweak the application to my own specifications.',
