    description: 'Initially the sole developer tasked with completely rebuilding and merging UNSW Global\'s existing four websites into one single WordPress solution.\n An entirely greenfields project with the only initial specifications being that it must be built with WordPress and that it needs to be intuitive to use for a publisher not familiar with complex code; max assumed knowledge would be basic HTML & CSS, no PHP/JS/SCSS etc.\n Architected a solution that leveraged third-party plugins in conjunction with custom code to enable UNSW Global to easily build and customize the site with a comprehensive drag and drop solution. Combined with a fresh modular design we were able to deliver an easy to use scalable solution that was completely bespoke and suited the clients requirements.\n Moreover, incorporated new processes and systems for other developers to follow; 3-stage build environment in the form of Dev -> Staging -> Production across local and AWS environments | introduced version control, GIT workflow, repository and code management within a team structure. Handed over a complex product that is easy to use for users with little code knowledge while also ensuring a clean and stable code base for future development teams.'
