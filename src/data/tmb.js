    description: 'Fantastic project from start to finish, built on top of the Sitecore CMS.  Working cohesively with all stakeholders the project was designed, coded, project managed very holistically; all components were named, designed, coded and refrenced the same throughout the entire project allowing everyone to be on the same page at all times.  Still one of the best projects that I have worked on to this day and have held on to and try to incorporate in current projects many of the principles that made it work so well.'
