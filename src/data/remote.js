    description: 'Due to establishing strong relationships and confidence in my skillset and work ethic, I was able to focus solely on contract work, both onsite and fully remote for the best part of 15 months. Projects, clients, programming languages and tech-stacks were varied ranging in the form of Wordpress, Sitecore, PHP, Node and Vue.js to name but a few.\n Both rewarding and challenging in that as a contractor the project must be completed on time, with only your own skillset and perseverance to rely on.'
